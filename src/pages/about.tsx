              <p>
                <strong>BurnShot</strong> is a simple yet powerful tool for
                sharing images/screenshots securely. Unlike traditional file-sharing,
                BurnShot ensures your images disappear after a set number of views
                or a time limit — no lingering files, no accidental oversharing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Built with privacy in mind, BurnShot doesn’t require signups or
                personal data. You’re always in control of how long your shared
                content lives online.
              </p>
              <p>
                BurnShot is proudly developed and maintained by{" "}

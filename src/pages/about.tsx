            <p>
              <strong>BurnShot</strong> is a secure, ephemeral screenshot sharing service.
              It allows you to upload images with strict expiry and view limits,
              ensuring sensitive content disappears after it has served its purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
              BurnShot is proudly developed and maintained by{" "}
              <strong>LogicLooms Lab</strong>. Our mission is to provide simple,
              privacy-focused tools that respect user data and prevent oversharing.
            </p>
            <p>
              With BurnShot, your screenshots are never permanent â€” they burn
              after viewing.
